# Huckleberry Task Manager - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the remaining features needed to complete the Huckleberry Task Manager VS Code extension. Huckleberry is an AI-powered task management extension that helps developers track and organize tasks within VS Code through natural language interaction with a chat participant leveraging the VS Code Language Model API. While significant implementation has been completed, several key features still require development to deliver a fully functional product that meets the original vision.

## 2. Current State Assessment

Based on the implementation documents reviewed, Huckleberry has established its core architecture and infrastructure:

- Nx monorepo structure established with VS Code extension and demo site
- Basic extension structure with Chat Participant implementation
- Language Model Tools API integration for file operations
- Task data schema defined
- Release workflow configured

However, several critical components from the original plan remain unimplemented or incomplete.

## 3. Remaining Features

### 3.1. Task Scanning and Auto-Discovery

- Support configurable regex patterns for identifying different TODO formats (// TODO:, /* TODO:, # TODO:, etc.)
- Allow filtering by file type, directory, or exclusion patterns
- Extract context from surrounding code to populate task descriptions
- Create tasks from identified TODOs with appropriate metadata

**Technical Implementation:**

```typescript
/**
 * Scans the workspace for TODO comments and converts them to tasks
 * @param options Configuration options for the TODO scanner
 * @returns A summary of discovered tasks
 */
async function scanWorkspaceForTodos(options: ScanOptions): Promise<TodoScanResult> {
  // Implementation
}
```

**Success Criteria:**

- Successfully identifies standard TODO formats across different programming languages
