The day has finally arrived. After weeks of coding, testing, debugging, and more than a few coffee-fueled epiphanies, Huckleberry is ready for its public alpha debut. It's not perfect,  no alpha release ever is,  but it's real, it works, and we think you're going to find it surprisingly useful for something so young.

## See Huckleberry in Action

Rather than tell you what Huckleberry can do, we thought we'd show you. Here's a quick tour of the alpha release:

## What's In The Bottle

Huckleberry might be young, but it's already packing some impressive capabilities:

**Natural-language task creation**,  No more rigid syntax or cryptic commands. Just tell Huckleberry what you need in plain English, right inside Copilot Chat, and watch as it turns your words into tracked tasks.

**Automated TODO scanning**,  Those scattered TODO comments in your code? Huckleberry rounds them up into properly managed tasks. When they show up in PR reviews, your teammates will think you've suddenly become incredibly organized.

**Agent mode integration**,  Sometimes the best UI is no UI at all. Huckleberry works seamlessly with Copilot's agent mode, letting you trigger task management tools without explicit commands. It's like having a colleague who just knows what you need.

**File-based task tracking**,  Everything gets stored in your project files, making it easy to share tasks with your team, include them in version control, and maintain a history of project progress.

## Saddle Up

Getting started with Huckleberry takes all of about 30 seconds:

1. Download the VSIX from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cambridgemonorail/vscode-huckleberry)
2. In VS Code, open Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X) > â‹¯ > Install from VSIX
3. Select the downloaded file, and you're ready to ride

Once installed, just open the Copilot Chat panel and type `@Huckleberry help` to see what it can do for you.

## Calling All Trail Blazers

Huckleberry is designed for developers who don't mind a few rough edges if it means being part of shaping something valuable. If you're the kind of person who enjoys test-driving experimental tools and having a say in their evolution, we need your feedback.

This alpha release is just the beginning. We have big plans for Huckleberry, but we want to make sure we're building in the right direction,  the one that actually makes your development workflow better, not just different.

Drop issues, suggestions, or pull requests on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/cambridgemonorail/vscode-huckleberry). Tell us what works, what doesn't, and what you wish it could do. Your input now will directly influence what ships in the next release.

## Your Huckleberry Is Waiting

There's something uniquely satisfying about finding a tool that fits just right into your workflow,  one that feels like it was made for you because, in many ways, it was. We built Huckleberry to solve our own frustrations with task management, but we're sharing it because we suspect we're not the only ones who've been looking for a better way.

So give Huckleberry a try. It might just be your new best friend in VS Code,  your faithful task-wrangling sidekick, ready whenever you need it.

And if anyone asks why you're suddenly so much more organized, you can just tell them: "I'm your Huckleberry."

## FAQs

### Q: How do I get started with Huckleberry after installation?

A: After installation, open the Copilot Chat panel and type `@Huckleberry help` to see available commands. You can then initialize task tracking in your workspace and start creating or importing tasks.
