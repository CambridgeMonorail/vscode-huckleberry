- Start with `@Huckleberry` to address the chat participant
- Clearly state the action you want to perform (create, list, mark, scan)
- Provide necessary details like task descriptions, IDs, or priorities
- Use natural language - you don't need to remember exact command syntax

## Examples with Responses

## Using Chat Effectively

For the best experience with Huckleberry in chat:

- Be specific in your requests to avoid ambiguity
- Use task IDs when referring to specific tasks
- Remember that you can have a conversational flow with follow-up questions
- Take advantage of the AI-powered assistance to help manage your tasks

## Advanced Usage

You can combine commands in natural ways:

**User**: `@Huckleberry What are my high priority tasks and mark TASK-002 as complete when I finish it`

**Huckleberry** will list high priority tasks and provide instructions for marking TASK-002 as complete.
