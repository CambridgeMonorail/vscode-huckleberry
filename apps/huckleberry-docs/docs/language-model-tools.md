# Language Model Tools (Agent Mode)

Huckleberry integrates with the VS Code Language Model Tools API (also known as "Copilot Agent Mode"), allowing AI-powered assistants like GitHub Copilot to directly interact with Huckleberry's task management capabilities without requiring explicit `@Huckleberry` mentions.

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro tip:** For the best experience with Huckleberry's language model tools, we currently recommend using Claude models in Copilot agent mode. Enable agent mode by opening VS Code settings and setting `github.copilot.chat.localeOverride` to `"en-US"`, then selecting Claude as your model from the Copilot chat dropdown.

## What are Language Model Tools?

Language Model Tools (or Agent Mode) is a VS Code API that allows extensions to register "tools" that can be used by language models like GitHub Copilot. When these tools are registered:

1. The language model can detect when a tool might be useful in a conversation
2. The model can call the tool directly to perform actions or retrieve information
3. The results are incorporated into the model's response

This creates a seamless experience where the AI can help manage tasks without requiring explicit `@Huckleberry` mentions.

## Available Tools

Huckleberry provides the following Language Model Tools for use in agent mode:

### create_task

**Purpose:** Creates a new task in the Huckleberry Task Manager

**Parameters:**

- `description` (required): Description of the task
- `priority` (optional): Priority level - can be "low", "medium", "high", or "critical"

**Example usage scenarios:**

- When discussing a feature implementation in chat, Copilot might offer to create a task for it
- When planning work for a sprint
- When identifying bug fixes needed

**Example conversation:**

```
User: I need to implement user authentication for my app
Copilot: Would you like me to create a task for implementing user authentication?
User: Yes, please make it high priority
Copilot: I've created task TASK-001: Implement user authentication with high priority
```

### initialize_tracking

**Purpose:** Sets up task tracking for a project workspace

**Parameters:** None required

**Example usage scenarios:**

- When starting a new project
- When adding task tracking to an existing project
- When a user first mentions they want to organize their work

**Example conversation:**

```
User: I'm starting a new project and want to keep track of my tasks
Copilot: Would you like me to initialize task tracking for this project?
User: Yes, please
Copilot: I've set up task tracking in the 'tasks' directory. You can now create and manage tasks.
```

### scan_todos

**Purpose:** Scans the codebase for TODO comments and converts them to tasks

**Parameters:**

- `pattern` (optional): File pattern to scan (e.g., '**/*.ts') - if not provided, scans all files

**Example usage scenarios:**

- When doing code cleanup
- When taking over a project with many TODO comments
- When preparing for a release and need to address remaining TODO items

**Example conversation:**

```
User: There are a lot of TODOs in our codebase that we need to address
Copilot: Would you like me to scan for TODOs and convert them to tasks?
User: Yes, but only in the TypeScript files
Copilot: I'll scan for TODOs in TypeScript files. I found 5 TODOs and created tasks for them.
```

### list_tasks

**Purpose:** Lists tasks from the task manager with optional filtering

**Parameters:**

- `priority` (optional): Filter by "low", "medium", "high", "critical", or "all"
- `status` (optional): Filter by "open", "in_progress", "done", or "all"

**Example usage scenarios:**

- When planning daily work
- When checking what high-priority items need attention
- When reviewing completed work

**Example conversation:**

```
User: What high priority tasks do we have left?
Copilot: Let me check the high priority tasks for you.
[Copilot lists the high priority tasks]
```

### mark_task_done

**Purpose:** Marks a task as complete

**Parameters:**

- `taskId` (required): ID of the task to mark as done

**Example usage scenarios:**

- After completing implementation of a feature
- After fixing a bug
- When updating task status after a code review

**Example conversation:**

```
User: I just finished implementing the login form
Copilot: Great! Would you like me to mark task TASK-003: "Implement login form" as complete?
User: Yes
Copilot: I've marked task TASK-003 as complete.
```

### update_task_priority

**Purpose:** Changes the priority of a task

**Parameters:**

- `taskId` (required): ID of the task to update
- `priority` (required): New priority - can be "low", "medium", "high", or "critical"

**Example usage scenarios:**

- When reprioritizing work
- When a task becomes more urgent
- When planning sprint work

**Example conversation:**

```
User: The authentication bug is more critical than we thought
Copilot: Would you like me to update the priority of task TASK-007: "Fix authentication bug"?
User: Yes, make it critical
Copilot: I've updated task TASK-007 to critical priority.
```

## How to Use Agent Mode Tools

To use Huckleberry's tools in agent mode:

1. Make sure Copilot Agent Mode is enabled (look for "Agent:" in the chat interface header)
2. If Agent Mode is not enabled:
   - Open VS Code settings
   - Search for "github.copilot.chat.localeOverride"
   - Set it to `"en-US"`
   - Restart VS Code if needed
3. Select Claude as your model from the Copilot chat dropdown (recommended for best results)
4. Start chatting with Copilot about your tasks and project

Copilot will automatically detect when to use Huckleberry's tools based on the conversation context.

## Example Complete Workflow

Here's a complete example of a task management workflow using Huckleberry's agent mode tools:

**User**: "I'm starting a new feature for our e-commerce platform. I need to track the tasks for it."

**GitHub Copilot**: "I'd be happy to help you set up task tracking for your e-commerce feature. Would you like me to initialize task tracking for this project?"

**User**: "Yes, please."

**GitHub Copilot**: "I've initialized task tracking in this project. The tasks will be stored in the 'tasks' directory. Now, let's create some tasks for your e-commerce feature. What specific tasks do you need to track?"

**User**: "I need to implement a shopping cart, product search, and payment processing."

**GitHub Copilot**: "I'll create tasks for those features. I've created the following tasks:

- TASK-001: Implement shopping cart functionality
- TASK-002: Create product search feature
- TASK-003: Develop payment processing system

Would you like to prioritize any of these tasks?"

**User**: "Make the payment processing high priority."

**GitHub Copilot**: "I've updated TASK-003: Develop payment processing system to high priority. Is there anything else you'd like to do with these tasks?"

**User**: "Let's also check if there are any TODOs in the codebase related to e-commerce."

**GitHub Copilot**: "I'll scan for TODOs in the codebase. I found 2 TODOs related to e-commerce and created tasks for them:

- TASK-004: Update product model with new fields (from TODO in src/models/Product.ts)
- TASK-005: Fix cart calculation logic (from TODO in src/services/CartService.ts)

Would you like to see all your current tasks?"

**User**: "Yes, show me all high priority tasks."

**GitHub Copilot**: "Here are all your high priority tasks:

- TASK-003: Develop payment processing system
- TASK-005: Fix cart calculation logic

These would be good tasks to focus on first."

## Benefits of Tool Integration

- **Seamless experience**: The AI can manage tasks without breaking the conversational flow
- **Contextual awareness**: Tools are invoked based on the conversation context
- **Reduced friction**: Users don't need to remember specific command syntax
- **Proactive assistance**: The AI can suggest task operations at appropriate moments

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues with Huckleberry's Agent Mode tools:

1. **Check Agent Mode status**: Make sure "Agent:" appears in the chat interface header
2. **Verify tool registration**: Run the command "Huckleberry (Dev): Check Copilot Agent Mode"
3. **Try a different model**: Different models have varying capabilities with tools. Claude models currently perform best with Huckleberry.
4. **Restart VS Code**: Sometimes a VS Code restart is needed after changing agent mode settings
