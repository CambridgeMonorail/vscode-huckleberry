## Feature Prioritization

We prioritize features based on:

1. **User impact** - How many users will benefit from the feature
2. **Technical feasibility** - What's possible given current VS Code API capabilities
3. **Strategic alignment** - How well the feature aligns with our core vision
4. **Community feedback** - What our users are requesting

## Providing Feedback

We welcome feedback on our roadmap and feature priorities. There are several ways to contribute your ideas:

- **GitHub Issues**: Submit feature requests through our issue tracker
- **Discussions**: Join our GitHub Discussions to talk about future directions
- **User Surveys**: Participate in our periodic user surveys
- **Community Calls**: Join our monthly community calls to discuss the roadmap

## Contributing to the Roadmap

If you'd like to help implement features on our roadmap:

1. Check the [Development](./development.md) guide for setup instructions
2. Look for issues labeled `roadmap` or `good-first-issue` in our GitHub repository
3. Join discussions on features you're interested in contributing to
4. Submit a pull request with your implementation

## Feature Voting

We use GitHub reactions on issues to gauge community interest in features. To vote for a feature:

1. Find the relevant feature request in our GitHub issues
2. Add a üëç reaction to show your support
3. Comment with any additional requirements or use cases you have

## Experimental Features

We sometimes implement experimental features that may or may not make it into stable releases. You can try these by:

1. Enabling the `huckleberry.enableExperimentalFeatures` setting
2. Providing feedback on experimental features you use

## Release Schedule

We aim for a predictable release cadence:

- **Feature releases** (versions 0.x.0): Approximately quarterly
- **Patch releases** (versions 0.x.y): As needed for bug fixes
- **Preview releases**: Available through the VS Code pre-release program

## Version Compatibility

We commit to maintaining compatibility with:

- The latest stable version of VS Code
- The previous two major releases of VS Code
- Standard workspace file formats for task data

## Deprecation Policy

When we need to deprecate features:

1. Features will be marked as deprecated at least one major version before removal
2. Deprecation notices will be included in the documentation and release notes
3. Migration paths will be provided for deprecated features
4. Breaking changes will only be introduced in major version updates
