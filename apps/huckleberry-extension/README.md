## Overview

Huckleberry is an AI-powered task manager that brings natural language task management directly into your VS Code workflow. Using VS Code's chat interface, you can have natural conversations with a dedicated Task Manager agent that helps you track, manage, and organise project tasks without leaving your development environment.

> **AI Transparency**: This extension uses VS Code's Language Model API. While these models are powerful tools for understanding natural language requests, they may sometimes produce responses that are incorrect or incomplete. We recommend verifying important decisions, especially for critical project components.

## FAQ

**Do I need GitHub Copilot?**
While basic task management works without Copilot, the AI-powered features require a GitHub Copilot subscription.

All tasks are stored locally in your workspace under the tasks directory (configurable). Tasks are saved as plain text files that can be version controlled.

**Can I use it offline?**
Basic task management works offline, but AI features require an internet connection.

**How do I migrate tasks?**
Simply copy the tasks directory between workspaces. All task data is stored in plain text files.

**Which languages are supported?**
Huckleberry works with any programming language. The TODO scanning feature supports all languages recognized by VS Code.

## Troubleshooting

### Chat Features Not Working

1. Ensure VS Code 1.93+ is installed
2. Verify GitHub Copilot is installed and signed in
3. If you opened a folder after VS Code started, reload the window
4. Check Output panel for "Huckleberry" logs

### Task Files Not Showing

1. Verify tasks directory exists
2. Run "Initialize Task Tracking" command
3. Check workspace write permissions

### AI Features Not Working

1. Verify active Copilot subscription
2. Check internet connection
3. Try switching language model
4. Reload workspace

## Privacy and Data Handling

Your privacy is important to us. Huckleberry:

- Uses VS Code's Language Model API for natural language processing
- Stores task data locally in your workspace
- Does not collect telemetry or personal data
- Does not send workspace data to external services except for AI processing via VS Code's API
- Requires GitHub Copilot access for AI features

## Known Limitations

- **Alpha Status**: This extension is in early development (0.1.24). Features may be incomplete or change.
- **AI Dependencies**:  
  - Requires active internet connection

  - AI suggestions may contain errors and should be reviewed
  - AI features may not work in restricted or airgapped environments
- **Performance**:  
  - Initial task parsing of large documents may take a few seconds
  - Recommended RAM: 8GB for optimal performance
- **Language Support**: While the extension works with any programming language, it has been primarily tested with:  
  - TypeScript/JavaScript
  - Python
  - C#
