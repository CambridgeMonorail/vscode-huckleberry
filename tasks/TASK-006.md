# TASK-006: Create a src/lib folder for pure, easily testable code

## Details
- **Priority**: medium
- **Status**: Done
- **Created**: 5/10/2025
- **Est. Effort**: 2 hours
- **Completed**: 5/11/2025

## Description
Create a dedicated `src/lib` folder structure for pure logic functions across the extension. This folder will contain code that doesn't depend on VS Code APIs or other external systems, making it easier to test and maintain.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create the main `src/lib` directory
- [x] Establish subdirectory structure to mirror the main src directory where appropriate
- [x] Create initial pure function modules in the lib directory
- [x] Document the purpose and guidelines for the lib directory
- [x] Ensure the directory structure supports future expansion

## Implementation Details
1. Created the folder structure:
   ```
   apps/huckleberry-extension/src/lib/
     tasks/           # Task-related pure functions
     utils/           # General utility pure functions
   ```

2. Implemented as part of TASK-005, with the first set of pure logic functions extracted into taskUtils.lib.ts

3. Future work will involve extracting more pure functions from:
   - `parameterUtils.ts`
   - Other utility files
   - Service layer business logic

- TASK-009: Add tests for task manipulation functions

## Notes
- This directory will be the foundation for improved test coverage
- Follow the pattern of `*.lib.ts` for pure logic function files
- Keep files focused on single responsibility
