# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Don't be a dick.

## The Slightly Longer Version

Huckleberry is a friendly project. We're here to build something useful, learn from each other, and enjoy the process. You don't need to agree with everyone, but you do need to be respectful.

That means:

- No personal attacks
- No discrimination of any kind
- No harassment, trolling, or passive-aggressive nonsense
- No GitHub drive-bys with snarky one-liners and zero context

If someone raises a concern, listen and respond in good faith. If you're having a bad day, maybe take a walk before hitting "Comment".

## What Happens If You Ignore This

If you break the spirit of this code, you may get a warning. If you keep at it, you may be blocked or banned. This isn't a courtroom and we're not interested in long debates about the edges. The maintainers get to make the call.

## Final Thought

We're all volunteers here, trying to do good work. Treat people how you'd want to be treated. Build something better. Help each other out. That's it.
